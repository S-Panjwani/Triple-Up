# Triple-Up

This was a small Python bot I made a long time ago to mess around with automating tic-tac-toe calculations in the Roblox game Double Down.

## Project Status

This is an old project and is now archived.

I don’t plan on working on it or fixing anything in the future — it’s just something I’m keeping around.

MainGUI.py creates a tkinter window to display board status + best move  
MainCMD.py displays board status + best move in the command line

---

## What It Did

This thing:

- Looked at specific pixels for X and O on the gameboard  
- Considered the color of each pixel to see the status of that square  
- Used the Minimax algorithm to calculate the best move  

It only worked on:

- Windows  
- With the Roblox window on the left half of the left monitor **[1920 x 1080]**
