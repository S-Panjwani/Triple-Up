# Triple-Up

This was a small Python bot I made a long time ago to mess around with automating tic-tac-toe calculations in the Roblox game **Double Down**.

## Project Status

This is an old project and is now archived.

I don’t plan on working on it or fixing anything in the future — it’s just something I’m keeping around.

## What It Did

Back when it worked, it:

- Automated some basic gameplay actions  
- Ran simple rule-based logic  

It only worked on:

- Windows  
- With the Roblox window on the right half of the left monitor
